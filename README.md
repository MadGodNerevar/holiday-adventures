## 🌐 Task Tracker

Browse existing tasks (GitHub Issues) and create new ones from our GitHub Pages site:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/holiday-adventures/
```

Tasks correspond to GitHub Issues, so you'll still see templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` as required by GitHub.

To submit a task, provide a personal access token with `repo` scope in the page's authentication section. The token is saved only in your browser storage under the key `HOLIDAY_TOKEN`.

This static site is published from the `docs/` directory via a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the build to the `gh-pages` branch.
